Your driver will meet you at the arrival hall displaying the passenger name on a name board. A Meet and Greet representative will meet you at the terminal's designated meeting point, often at the arrivals gate or a specific area in the terminal. The representative will assist with luggage, guide you through immigration (if needed), and help you to your transport. A Meet and Greet service can assist you with checking in, handling luggage, and guiding you through security checks. You will be met at the airport entrance and escorted to your airline check-in desk.
