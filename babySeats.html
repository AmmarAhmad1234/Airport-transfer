            <p class="service-para meet-para cruise-para Sightseeing-para group-para hours-para Baby-para">Let us know if you travel with babies or small children, we will be happy to provide special baby or child seats. If you are booking online, please indicate this on the booking form and select an appropriate seat for your child.  We want to make sure that the little ones travel in comfort and safety too. When booking your coach or minibus, always mention how many baby seats you need, so the company can reserve them for your group. Some companies might automatically provide baby seats if requested, but itâ€™s always a good idea to confirm the request when you book. You can either do this by phone, email, or through their online booking form.
